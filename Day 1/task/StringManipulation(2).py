# So the aim of this is to showcase a few extra things we can do with string manipulation :)
# We begin by looking at how to take (1) (below) and print it in a single command.

print("Hello world!")
print("Hello world!")
print("Hello world!")

#--------------------------#

# 1. How to print multiple lines using /n #

print("Hello world!\nHello world!")

# Own practice # Take note of what happens when there are spaces before and after the \n tag

print("So this is pretty cool \nI did not know you could do this\nand where would this become useful\n well right here :)")
print("Hello\n Hello\n  Hello\n   Hello")

# 2. String Concatenation
# Combine different strings so they will be added to the end of other strings

print("Hello + Dominic") # Notice what happens here (Emphasis on TWO STRINGS)

print("Hello" + "Dominic") # Combined into 1, no spaces

print("Hello" + " Dominic") # Combine into 1, add a space
print("Hello" + " " + "Dominic")
print("Hello " + "Dominic")

# SPACES in python programming are incredibly IMPORTANT. Spaces added in code!

# print("Hello " + "Dominic") # Indentation Error #

print ("Hello") #Unindented warning

# --------- # 

# Debugging Practice #

# Look at the code below ðŸ‘‡. There are errors on all 5 lines. Fix the code so that there are no errors (Just uncomment) #

# print(Notes from Day 1") 
#  print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# print("Strings are strings of characters"
# priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")

print("Notes from Day 1")
print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
